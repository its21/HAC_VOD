%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}
Introduction.

\section{Observations}

Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.

\subsection{Maths}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}.

    \caption{Spatial distribution of the RR Lyrae used in this work with full 6-D phase space measurements, in Galactic coordinates (left panel) and in the $x-y$ (middle) and $y-z$ (right) planes.  The HAC field contains 44 RR Lyrae which likely belong to the Cloud with measured line-of-sight  velocities (Simion et al. 2018) and  Gaia DR2 proper motions. The VOD field contains 411 RRL which belong to several halo associations, including the Sagittarius stream and the VOD, with line-of-sight velocities provided by Vivas et al. 2016 and proper motions from Gaia DR2. In particular we mark three `high significance' groups, excluding the Sagittarius stream,  identified by Vivas et al. 2016: `group 2' contains 18 stars (green circles), `group 3', 7 stars (orange squares) and `group 4', 5 stars (blue triangles). Two other `high significance' groups are not marked in this figure as they are situated at distances larger than 30 kpc and contain only 3 stars each. We exclude from all the plots in this letter `group 1' which contains Sagittarius members (112 stars). The Sun (yellow star) is located at (x$_{\odot}$, y$_{\odot}$, z$_{\odot})= $ (0,-8,0) kpc .  }

    \caption{RRL velocity distribution in spherical polar coordinates ($v_{r}$, $v_{\theta}$, $v_{\phi}$  are the radial, azimuthal and polar components respectively) in the HAC field (top row) and the VOD field (middle and bottom rows). The error on the velocity components of each star $i $, [$\sigma^{i}_{v_{r}}$, $\sigma^{i}_{v_{\theta}}$, $\sigma^{i}_{v_{\phi}}$], has been propagated by randomly drawing 1000 stars from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean the measurement (ra$^{i}$, dec$^{i}$, d$^{i}$, pmra$^{i}$, pmdec$^{i}$, $v^{i}_{h}$) and full covariance matrix (takes into account the covariances between ra,dec and proper motions). The orbital anisotropy, is highly radial in the HAC field ($\beta = 0.88$) where the stars are most likely members of the Cloud and mildly radial in the VOD field ($\beta = 0.48$) in which stars span a much wider range of distances (see Fig. \ref{fig:lb}). We fit the VOD velocity ellipsoid with a two component Gaussian mixture model and the result is shown in the bottom row. Stars are colour coded by their probability to belong to each component. (NOTE: this is NOT extreme deconvolution -simply used sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture with no contraints on any parameter-, no errors taken into account. Please have a look at the last figure for extreme deconvolution). }

   \caption{Radial versus azimuthal velocity in the VOD field, in three slices of Z, colour coded as in the bottom row of Fig. \ref{fig:vel}. We calculate the fraction of RR Lyrae of Oosterhoff type I and II (reported in each panel for Oo I) and find that in the 10$<$z/kpc$<$20 range, where the orbital anisotropy is the highest, the Oo I type dominates  (77\%), as in the HAC field (note: add number here). In the same slice, 73\% of the stars belong to the `sausage' component. The same behaviour but less accentuated can be noticed in the 0$<$z/kpc$<$10 slice where $\beta$ is  less radial but the fraction of Oo I stars decreases drammatically (note: comment if this is expected?). Further from the plane, at  z$>$20 kpc, the velocity ellipsoid is almost isotropic with $\beta = -0.3$. We have excluded the most likely members of the Sagittarius stream but several others may remain, decreasing $\beta$.  (note: I should add constant z lines in the right panel of figure 1 if we keep this). This figure should replace the bottom row of Figure 2? - }

The fractions I reported in Figure 3, are based on these figures. bottom row: this is Figure 3, just colour coded by z instead of showing 3 different cuts. I liked the cuts because it's very easy to see the anisotropy is the highest in the 10$<z<$20 range, like the HAC. }

\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
