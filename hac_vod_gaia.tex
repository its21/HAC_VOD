\section{Introduction}

How do you hide the evidence for a massive impact event that caused
the extinction of most of the dinosaurs as well as 75\% of all species
on Earth? You bury it deep under the sea, covered with a layer of
sediment taller than the Empire State Building
\citep[][]{Hildebrand1991}. Without the discovery of the giant
Chicxulub crater, the meteorite impact hypothesis would remain a neat
theory supported by striking but indirect evidence. A hypothesis of an
ancient dramatic collision between the Milky Way and an unidentified
massive dwarf galaxy was put forward by \citet{Deason2013} to explain
a particular feature in the overall stellar halo density profile
\citep[][]{Wa09,De11}. Most recently, through a study of a portion of
the nearby stellar halo, \citet{Belokurov2018} demonstrated that the
great impactor must have collided with the young Milky Way on a nearly
radial orbit, thus swamping the inner stellar halo with metal-rich
material with orbital anisotropy \citep[see][]{Binney2008} close to
unity. Merger events like this tend to leave behind a battery of
debris clouds and shells \citep[see][]{Amorisco2015,Hendel2015}, which
- akin to the peak rings of impact craters \citep[see
  e.g.][]{Morgan2016} - if discovered could help to reconstruct the
collision as well as pin down the properties of the progenitor
\citep[e.g][]{Sanderson2013,Johnston2016}.

Before the Data Release 2 \citep[][]{Brown2018} of the ESA's Gaia
mission \citep[][]{Prusti2016}, five large and diffuse cloud-like
structures had been discovered in the Galaxy's halo. These include:
the Virgo Over-Density
\citep[VOD,][]{Vivas2001,Newberg2002,Duffau2006,Juric2008,Bonaca2012},
the Hercules-Aquila Cloud \citep[HAC,][]{Be07,Simion2014}, the
Trinagulum-Andromeda structure
\citep[Tri-And,][]{Rocha2004,Majewski2004,Deason2014}, the Pisces
Over-density \citep[][]{Sesar2007,Wa09,Nie2015} and the
Eridanus-Phoenix over-density \citep[Eri-Pho,][]{Li2016}. According to
the most recent investigations, Tri-And likely comprises of Galactic
disc stars kicked out of the plane in a recent interaction with a
dwarf galaxy, probably the Sagittarius dSph
\citep[e.g.][]{Pr15,Bergemann2018,Hayes2018}. Of the remaining four,
the Pisces overdensity clearly stands out as it reaches much larger
Galacto-centric distances. On the other hand, the VOD, HAC and Eri-Pho
structures occupy a very similar range of distances, between 10 and 20
kpc from the Galactic center. This lead \citet{Li2016} to suggest that
these three Clouds could all be part of one merger event, a galaxy
accreted onto the Milky Way on a polar orbit \citep[see
  also][]{Juric2008}.

As demonstrated by the recent re-interpretation of the Monoceros Ring
(and the associated sub-structures) and the Tri-And, deciphering the
nature of halo over-densities is often impossible without either
high-resolution spectroscopy \citep[e.g.][]{Bergemann2018} or accurate
astrometry \citep[e.g.][]{deBoer2018,Deason2018}. In this Letter, we
look for clues to the formation of the Hercules-Aquila and Virgo
Clouds using proper motions provided as part of the Gaia DR2. At our
disposal are highly pure samples of members of each Cloud, namely the
RR Lyrae stars that i) are co-spatial with HAC and VOD in 3-D and ii)
that have their line-of-sight velocities measured. By complementing
the publicly available 4-D data with the GDR2 proper motions, we build
a large tracer set with complete 6-D phase space information and study
the make-up of each structure using the orbital properties of the
constituent stars.

    \caption{Spatial distribution of the RR Lyrae used in this work with full 6-D phase space measurements, in Galactic coordinates (left panel) and in the $x-y$ (middle) and $y-z$ (right) planes.  The HAC field contains 44 RR Lyrae which likely belong to the Cloud with measured line-of-sight  velocities (Simion et al. 2018) and  Gaia DR2 proper motions. The VOD field contains 411 RRL which belong to several halo associations, including the Sagittarius stream and the VOD, with line-of-sight velocities provided by Vivas et al. 2016 and proper motions from Gaia DR2. In particular we mark group 2, a `high significance' kinematical group, which contains 18 stars (green circles). The semi-circles are centred on the Sun's position and have radius of 10 and 20 kpc. The Sun (yellow star) is located at (x$_{\odot}$, y$_{\odot}$, z$_{\odot})= $ (0,-8,0) kpc and the Galactic centre at (0,0,0) - black circle.  }
    \label{fig:lb}
\end{figure*}
The Hercules-Aquila  and Virgo Clouds were first identified as stellar halo overdensities, situated at intermediate distances (10 - 20 kpc) from the Sun. \citet{Simion2014} used RR Lyrae from the Catalina Schmidt Survey to measure the peak of the HAC overdensity from which it was then possible to select candidates for spectroscopic follow-up.  In total, 46 HAC RRL have radial velocity measurements in a narrow distance range, between 15 and 18 kpc, where the peak of the HAC overdensity lies (table 2, \citealt{Simion2018}) . \cite{Vivas2016} compiled a catalog of 412 RRL in the region of the VOD with distances between 4 and 75 kpc from the Sun with measurements from a range of surveys. 
%
\subsection{6-D Phase space measurements}

%
44 of the 46 stars in table 1 in \cite{Simion2018} and 411 of the 412 in table 4 in \cite{Vivas2016} with matches within 2'' in the Gaia DR2 catalog, have proper motion measurements. \\ 
The only star in the VOD region without proper motion measurement, belongs to a `high-significance' kinematical group (group 1), likely the Sagittarius stream, identified by \cite{Vivas2016}. 113 stars (112 with proper motions) belong to this group and we have excluded them for the analysis as a major contaminant of the VOD field. The spatial distribution of the remaining stars (44 from \citealt{Simion2018} and 299 from \citealt{Vivas2016}) with full 6-D phase space measurements is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:lb}, in Galactic coordinates (left panel) and in the Galactic plane and perpendicular to the Galactic plane projections. We adopted left-handed Galactic Cartesian coordinates with the Sun located at (x$_{\odot}$,y$_{\odot}$, z$_{\odot}$) = (-8,0,0) kpc, the X-axis positive in the direction of the Galactic center, Y-axis oriented along the Galactic rotation and the Z-axis directed towards the north Galactic pole.\\
\citealt{Vivas2016} identified 6 significant kinematical groups in the VOD field (their table 5) but only groups 1 and 2 (likely members of the VOD, with $<v_{GSR}>= 135$ km/s) contain more than 10 stars. We mark group 2 with green circles.

The error on the velocity components of each star $i $, [$\sigma^{i}_{v_{r}}$, $\sigma^{i}_{v_{\theta}}$, $\sigma^{i}_{v_{\phi}}$], has been propagated by randomly drawing 1000 stars from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean the measurement (ra$^{i}$, dec$^{i}$, d$^{i}$, pmra$^{i}$, pmdec$^{i}$, $v^{i}_{h}$) and full covariance matrix (takes into account the covariances between ra,dec and proper motions). The orbital anisotropy, is highly radial in the HAC field ($\beta = 0.91 \pm 0.03$) where the stars are most likely members of the Cloud and mildly radial in the VOD field ($\beta = 0.74 \pm 0.04$) in which stars span a much wider range of distances (see Fig. \ref{fig:lb}). }

\end{figure}
%
The velocity distribution in spherical polar coordinates ($v_{r}$, $v_{\theta}$, $v_{\phi}$  are the radial, azimuthal and polar components respectively) are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:vel}. To estimate the error on each velocity component we resample the data 1000 times  from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean the measurement \{ra$^{i}$, dec$^{i}$, d$^{i}$, pmra$^{i}$, pmdec$^{i}$, $v^{i}_{h}$\} and full covariance matrix which takes into account the covariances between ra, dec and proper motions, provided by Gaia DR2. We take the standard deviation of the resulting \{$v_{r}$, $v_{\theta}$, $v_{\phi}$\} distributions as the upper limit of the velocity uncertainties. These errors are reported for all stars in Fig. \ref{fig:vel}. \textit{Here I need to comment on the error bars, why so big for VOD, eg. higher distance, pm error etc}.\\
 The orbital anisotropy, is highly radial in the HAC field ($\beta = 0.91 \pm 0.03$) where the stars are most likely members of the Cloud and radial in the VOD field ($\beta = 0.74 \pm 0.04$) in which stars span a much wider range of distances. The anisotropy values are the median and standard deviation over 500 non parametric bootstrap resampling trials. Each trial was modelled with a velocity ellipsoid using the Extreme Deconvolution module implemented in  $\mathrm{astroML}$ \citep{astroML}.\\
Fig. \ref{fig:VOD_vel} shows the behaviour of the VOD azimuthal $v_{\theta}$ and radial $v_{r}$ distributions in 3 distance slices above the Galactic plane. In each slice we have calculated the fraction of Oosterhoff type I (Oo I) RR Lyrae, using equations 1 and 2 in \citet{Be2018} to classify the RRL into two types. According to this classification, Oosterhoff type II (Oo II) RR Lyrae will incude both Oo II and Intermediate objects. \\
 In the 10$<$z/kpc$<$20 range, where the orbital anisotropy is the highest ($\beta = 0.84 \pm 0.03$), the Oo I type dominates  (77\%), as in the HAC field (note: add number here). In the same slice, 73\% of the stars belong to the `sausage' component. The same behaviour but less accentuated can be noticed in the 0$<$z/kpc$<$10 slice where $\beta = 0.7 \pm 0.1$ is  less radial but the fraction of Oo I stars decreases drammatically (note: comment if this is expected?). Further from the plane, at  z$>$20 kpc, the velocity ellipsoid is almost isotropic with $\beta = -0.1 \pm 0.2$. We have excluded the most likely members of the Sagittarius stream but several others may remain, decreasing $\beta$.

We integrate orbits using the $\mathrm{galpy}$ package \citet{Bovy2015} in the recommended  $\mathrm{MWPotential2014}$ model for the Galactic potential which is composed of a Miyamoto-Nagai disc, a bulge with a power-law density profile that is exponentially cut-off, and a dark matter halo described by a NFW potential. The parameters are given in table 1 \citet{Bovy2015}. The resulting orbital properties of the HAC and VOD are given in Fig \ref{fig:orbits}. To compute the errors (not shown for VOD to simply the figure) we integrated 500 orbits for each star where the orbits were initialised on parameters resampled from data, as in the previous section. The pdf of the eccentricities is also shown.

\section{Conclusions}

Using a sample of $\sim$500 RR Lyrae with full 6-D phase space
information, we have studied the orbital properties of the
Hercules-Aquila and Virgo Clouds. Both Clouds appear dominated by
stars on highly eccentric orbits. Assuming that the kinematics of each
structure is well described by a single Gaussian, the orbital
anisotropy of the HAC is $\beta=0.91$ and for the VOD,
$\beta=0.74$. Note, however that the original criteria applied to the
RR Lyrae stars to select targets for spectroscopic follow-up differ
drastically between the HAC and the VOD datasets. The HAC sample
covers a very limited region in the of $l,b, D$ space, while the VOD
dataset spans a wide range of longitudes, latitudes and heliocentric
distances. It is therefore likely that the VOD dataset contains a
mixture of several halo sub-structures \citep[see][for a detailed
  discussion]{Vivas2016}. For the entirety of the analysis described
here, we made sure to cull the probable Sgr stream
members. Additionally, we explore how the VOD's make-up changes with
Galactic height and demonstrate that for $|z|<20$ kpc, the VOD orbital
anisotropy is $\beta\sim 0.84$, while above this threshold, it quickly
changes to $\beta\sim0$. We conclude therefore, that an assumption of
a single Gaussian for the entire VOD sample is not
appropriate. Modeling the kinematics of the VOD stars with a mixture
of 2 multi-variate Gaussians, we show that two thirds of the VOD
sample are the stars with $\beta=0.96$, while the remainder has
$\beta=0.44$, in good agreement with the local measurement presented
in \citet{Belokurov2018}.

As revealed by Gaia, the two structures are composed of stars on
nearly radial orbits, with peaks in the eccentricity distribution at
0.9 (0.8) for the HAC (VOD). The distributions of the peri-centric and
apo-centric distances also match: the stars in the Clouds turn around
at $1-3$ and $15-30$ kpc. Not only the HAC and the VOD look alike
kinematically, their orbital composition is in perfect agreement with
the stellar halo properties as analysed locally by
\citet{Belokurov2018} and globally (out to 40 kpc) by
\citet{Deason2018pileup}. As these authors demonstrate, the inner halo
is dominated by metal-rich debris from an old and massive accretion
event. In particular, \citet{Belokurov2018} use Cosmological
simulations of Milky Way halo formation, to bracket the time of the
merger - between 8 and 11 Gyr ago - and its mass, which they show to
be in excess of $10^{10} M_{\odot}$. The tell-tale sign of this
dramatic head-on collision is the particular shape of the
corresponding stellar velocity ellipsoid, which is stretched so much
in the radial direction compared to the tangential ones, that it
resembles a sausage. An alternative view of this merger can be found
in \citet{actionhalo}, where the local stellar halo is mapped out in
the action space. Here, the metal-rich stars are shown have extended
radial action distribution in addition to a prominent spray of
material on retrograde orbits. The high mass of the progenitor is
evidenced not only by the metallicity distribution of its likely
member or the numerical simulations of halo formation, but also by a
sizeable number of Globular Clusters that could be attributed to the
same event \citep[see][]{sausagegc}.
