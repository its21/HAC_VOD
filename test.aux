The HAC field contains 44 RR Lyrae which likely belong to the Cloud with measured line-of-sight velocities (Simion et al. 2018) and Gaia DR2 proper motions. The VOD field contains 411 RRL which belong to several halo associations, including the Sagittarius stream and the VOD, with line-of-sight velocities provided by Vivas et al. 2016 and proper motions from Gaia DR2. In particular we mark three `high significance' groups, excluding the Sagittarius stream, identified by Vivas et al. 2016: `group 2' contains 18 stars (green circles), `group 3', 7 stars (orange squares) and `group 4', 5 stars (blue triangles). Two other `high significance' groups are not marked in this figure as they are situated at distances larger than 30 kpc and contain only 3 stars each. We exclude from all the plots in this letter `group 1' which contains Sagittarius members (112 stars).
